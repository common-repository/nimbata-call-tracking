== Description ==

This plugin adds the Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI) script for Nimbata's call tracking service. Discover which sources, marketing activities, keywords and more are driving phone calls and subsequent conversions.

When a visitor calls your tracking number, we’ll correlate the call with the source, session or campaign details you’ve setup in the Nimbata app.
